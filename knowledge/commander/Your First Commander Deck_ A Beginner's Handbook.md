# **Your First Commander Deck: A Beginner's Handbook**

### **Introduction: The Adventure Begins\!**

Welcome, future deckbuilder\! You're about to take your first steps into the vast and creative world of building a Commander deck from scratch. While grabbing an affordable, preconstructed deck is a fantastic way to start playing immediately, this handbook is for your next great adventure.

Building a deck is a significant investment—of your time, your mental energy, and of course, your money. That's why this handbook exists: to help you build something that is not only uniquely yours but that you will truly love to play. The process might seem intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. Think of this guide as your mentor, providing a simple framework and powerful tools to make deckbuilding feel approachable, fun, and rewarding. Let's get brewing\!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **1\. The Blueprint: A Starting Recipe for Success**

Every great deck, just like any great creation, needs a solid foundation. To get started, we'll use a simple "deckbuilding template" or "recipe." Think of these numbers as "guidance, not rules"—a framework designed to give your deck consistency and reduce the chances of it "crashing to a halt" mid-game.

### **1.1. Lands: The Most Important Ingredient**

Lands are the "bread and butter" of any deck and the most important component to get right. Without enough mana, your hand of powerful spells is useless.

A widely accepted starting point is **37-38 lands**. This number isn't random. While it may seem high, mathematical models show that to reliably have three lands in your opening hand, you'd need closer to 42 lands in your deck. Starting at 37-38 is a proven, practical compromise that factors in other sources of mana and ensures you can play a land each turn in the crucial early stages of the game.

Hitting your land drop every turn is still crucial to having a good game.

### **1.2. Ramp: Gaining an Edge**

"Ramp" refers to any card that accelerates your mana production, allowing you to cast your spells "ahead of curve" and race ahead of your opponents. A good guideline is to include **10 or more** ramp sources in your deck. Ramp can take many forms:

* **Spells:** Cards like `Cultivate`[^1] that search for lands.
* **Creatures (Mana Dorks):** Small creatures like `Llanowar Elves`[^2] that tap for mana.
* **Artifacts (Mana Rocks):** Noncreature artifacts like `Commander's Sphere`[^3] that provide mana.
* **Enchantments:** Auras like `Wolfwillow Haven`[^4] that enchant a land to produce more mana.

### **1.3. Card Draw: Keeping the Engine Running**

Drawing cards is, simply put, "one of the best things to do in Magic." It keeps your hand full of options and ensures you have the resources you need to execute your game plan. You should aim for **at least 10 cards** that draw you more cards. For maximum value, prioritize cards that provide:

* **Repeatable Draw:** Effects like `Guardian Project`[^5] that trigger multiple times.
* **Large Bursts of Draw:** Spells like `Blue Sun's Zenith`[^6] that can refill your entire hand at once.

### **1.4. Interaction: Answering Your Opponents' Threats**

Interaction is your suite of tools for answering your opponents' biggest threats, protecting your own board, and staying in the game. This category can be broken down into two key parts.

* **Single-Target Removal:** These are your scalpel-like answers to individual problems. A good starting point is **6-8 spells**. You'll want a healthy balance of cards that can handle creatures (like `Go for the Throat`[^7]) and others that can destroy artifacts or enchantments (like `Return to Dust`[^8]).
* **Board Wipes:** These are your "blanket answers" for when the battlefield gets out of control and you need to hit the reset button. Aim for a minimum of **5 board wipes** to ensure you can find one when things look dire.

### **1.5. Synergy: The Heart and Soul of Your Deck**

This category contains the cards that define your deck's personality and primary game plan. These are the engines, payoffs, and thematic pieces that your commander is built to support. This category will be the largest, consisting of **around 30 cards**. What falls into this category depends entirely on your commander and theme:

* Cards that support your primary theme (e.g., enchantments in an "enchantress" deck).
* Creatures that advance your combat-focused plan.
* Protection spells like `Heroic Intervention`[^9] or recursion spells like `Sevinne's Reclamation`[^10].

### **1.6. A Note on Creatures**

You might notice that "creatures" isn't a standalone category in this recipe. That's because creatures in Commander should ideally serve a utility role by fitting into one of the other categories. Instead of just running a big "beatstick," look for creatures that also act as Ramp, Card Draw, or Removal. For example, a card like `Noxious Gearhulk`[^11] isn't just a big attacker; it also serves as removal when it enters the battlefield and has artifact synergies, ticking multiple boxes at once.

While the final creature count is fluid and depends on your strategy, most Commander decks will run **upwards of 25 creatures**.

### **1.7. Your Starting Recipe (Summary Table)**

Here is a summary of the deckbuilding blueprint for easy reference.

| Category | Recommended Count | Primary Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Lands** | 37 \- 38 | Consistently play spells on curve. |
| **Ramp** | 10+ | Cast spells ahead of schedule. |
| **Card Draw** | 10+ | Keep your hand full of options. |
| **Removal** | 6 \- 8 | Answer individual threats from opponents. |
| **Board Wipes** | 5+ | Reset the board when you're behind. |
| **Synergy** | \~30 | Execute your deck's main game plan. |

Now that you have the architectural blueprint for a consistent deck, let's explore the best "supply store" on the internet to find the perfect, synergistic ingredients.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2\. Finding Your Cards with EDHREC**

Building a 99-card deck from the tens of thousands of Magic cards in existence can be daunting. Luckily, one of the most popular and effective online tools for new deckbuilders is **EDHREC**.

EDHREC's core function is to gather data from thousands of public decklists across the internet. It then compiles this data to provide card recommendations for any given commander, saving you a massive amount of time. As you find exciting cards on EDHREC, keep your "recipe" numbers in mind. This will help you decide which category a new card fits into and what it might replace, turning your blueprint into an active building tool.

### **2.1. Addressing a Common Concern**

Some players worry that using a tool like EDHREC will make their deck "too ‘samey’" or unoriginal. This couldn't be further from the truth. EDHREC is a tool for consideration, not a mandate. It shows you what's popular and synergistic, but you make the final call.

You are still building your own deck, you are still making the final decisions, and EDHREC is just a tool to aid you in this process.

### **2.2. A Practical Walkthrough: Building with Purphoros**

Let's walk through how to use EDHREC with an example commander: `Purphoros, Bronze-Blooded`[^12].

1. **High Synergy Cards:** This section shows cards that are more unique to your specific commander. For Purphoros, EDHREC reveals that 83% of decks play `Feldon of the Third Path`[^13]. This immediately shows you a powerful, related effect you might not have known about.
2. **Top Cards:** This section shows popular "staple" cards that work well in your commander's colors. For a mono-red commander like Purphoros, you'll find cards like `Chaos Warp`[^14] and `Meteor Golem`[^15]. These are excellent examples of how red decks can deal with challenging permanent types like enchantments, which the color normally struggles with.
3. **Finding Hidden Gems:** EDHREC is brilliant at revealing powerful interactions. For Purphoros, whose ability requires you to sacrifice the creature at the end of the turn, the site suggests `Sundial of the Infinite`[^16] and `Conjurer’s Closet`[^17]. These cards allow you to bypass Purphoros's downside and keep your powerful creatures permanently.

### **2.3. Building on a Budget**

Magic can be an expensive hobby, but EDHREC has invaluable tools for budget-conscious players. At the top of each commander's page, you'll find a **"Cheap"** budget filter.

This filter shows you data only from the least expensive 10% of decks for that commander, helping you find powerful synergies without breaking the bank. You don’t need a fifteen-dollar `Balefire Dragon`[^18] to clear away smaller creatures when a highly effective budget alternative like `Bloodfire Colossus`[^19], which costs only a quarter, can be just as effective.

With your recipe in hand and a powerful research tool at your fingertips, the next step is to look inward and ensure your creation truly reflects you.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3\. Building a Deck *You* Love to Play**

Beyond the numbers and online tools, the ultimate goal is to build a deck that is personally fun and enjoyable every time you play it. This final section offers tips to ensure your creation is a perfect fit for you.

### **3.1. Check In With Yourself**

Before you finalize your list, ask yourself what you truly enjoy doing in a game of Commander. Identifying your preferred playstyle is the most important step to building a deck you will love long-term. Consider these questions:

* Do you enjoy playing lots of big, powerful creatures and smashing face?
* Do you prefer casting tricky spells, controlling the board, and reacting to your opponents?
* Do you like attacking often and putting pressure on your opponents from the start?

There's no wrong answer, but knowing what you find fun will guide your card choices toward a more satisfying experience.

### **3.2. Test Before You Buy**

Before spending money on physical cards, always "playtest" your deck. Online deckbuilding websites like **Moxfield** have built-in playtesters that let you draw sample opening hands and play out the first few turns of a game by yourself (a process often called "goldfishing").

This is a free and incredibly valuable way to see if the deck "feels" right. Does it get enough lands? Is the mana curve too clunky? Does it function as you expected? Answering these questions before you buy can save you a lot of time and money.

### **3.3. Don't Be Afraid to Adjust**

A deck is never truly "finished." It's a living creation that will evolve as you play it. If you build a deck and find that some parts aren't fun or don't work well, you can always make changes. Deckbuilding is a process.

A common pitfall is to cut lands to add exciting new spells you've acquired. If your deck starts to feel inconsistent, don't hesitate to revisit the "Starting Recipe" from Section 1\. Often, the solution is as simple as ensuring your fundamentals—your lands, ramp, and card draw—are still at the right numbers.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Card Reference Footnotes**

[^1]: **Cultivate** (Green | {2}{G}): Search your library for up to two basic land cards, reveal them, put one onto the battlefield tapped and the other into your hand.
    *Relevance:* This is the quintessential "Spell Ramp" example. It not only accelerates your mana by putting a land into play but also ensures you hit your next land drop by putting one in your hand, satisfying two needs at once.

[^2]: **Llanowar Elves** (Green | {G}): Tap to add {G}.
    *Relevance:* The classic "Mana Dork." It illustrates how a cheap creature can serve as mana acceleration. Playing this on turn 1 allows you to play a 3-mana spell on turn 2, putting you ahead of opponents.

[^3]: **Commander's Sphere** (Colorless/Artifact | {3}): Tap to add one mana of any color in your commander's identity. Sacrifice it to draw a card.
    *Relevance:* Represents "Mana Rocks." It fixes your mana colors and has late-game utility; if you no longer need the mana, you can "cash it in" for a new card, which is excellent utility for beginners.

[^4]: **Wolfwillow Haven** (Green | {1}{G}): Enchant land. Enchanted land has "Tap: Add {G}." You can sacrifice it later to create a Wolf token.
    *Relevance:* Represents "Enchantment Ramp." Unlike creatures, lands enchanted with this are harder for opponents to destroy, making your mana production safer and more resilient to board wipes.

[^5]: **Guardian Project** (Green | {3}{G}): Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield under your control, if it doesn't share a name with a creature in your graveyard or on the battlefield, draw a card.
    *Relevance:* A prime example of "Repeatable Draw." Since Commander is a singleton format (only one of each card), this ability triggers on almost every creature you play, providing constant fuel throughout the game.

[^6]: **Blue Sun's Zenith** (Blue | {X}{U}{U}{U}): Target player draws X cards. Shuffle this spell into its owner's library.
    *Relevance:* Represents "Burst Draw." Late in the game when you have tons of mana but no cards, you can dump all your mana into "X" to completely refill your hand instantly.

[^7]: **Go for the Throat** (Black | {1}{B}): Destroy target nonartifact creature.
    *Relevance:* Efficient "Single-Target Removal." It shows how specific colors remove threats. It is cheap to cast but has a restriction (can't hit artifacts), teaching the importance of knowing your removal's limitations.

[^8]: **Return to Dust** (White | {2}{W}{W}): Exile target artifact or enchantment. If you cast this during your main phase, you may exile up to two targets instead.
    *Relevance:* Represents flexible removal for non-creature threats. It highlights the value of "Exile" (preventing opponents from bringing the card back from the graveyard) and "Modality" (getting a bonus for casting it on your turn).

[^9]: **Heroic Intervention** (Green | {1}{G}): Permanents you control gain hexproof and indestructible until end of turn.
    *Relevance:* A defensive "Protection Spell." It is used reactively to save your entire board from a "Board Wipe" or targeted destruction, fitting into the synergy category by keeping your game plan alive.

[^10]: **Sevinne's Reclamation** (White | {2}{W}): Return target permanent card with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield. It has "Flashback" (cast it again from the graveyard).
    *Relevance:* A "Recursion" spell. It allows you to reuse your ramp, small creatures, or utility artifacts that were destroyed, adding resilience to your deck.

[^11]: **Noxious Gearhulk** (Black | {4}{B}{B}): Menace. When it enters the battlefield, you may destroy another target creature. You gain life equal to its toughness.
    *Relevance:* Demonstrates a creature serving a "Utility Role." Rather than just attacking, it acts as a removal spell ("Murder") attached to a body, illustrating card efficiency (2-for-1 value).

[^12]: **Purphoros, Bronze-Blooded** (Red | {4}{R}): Indestructible God. Grants your creatures Haste. {2}{R}: You may put a red creature card or artifact creature card from your hand onto the battlefield. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.
    *Relevance:* The "Commander" example. His ability defines the deck's strategy: cheating big, expensive creatures into play for cheap to attack immediately, even though they die at the end of the turn.

[^13]: **Feldon of the Third Path** (Red | {1}{R}{R}): {2}{R}, Tap: Create a token that's a copy of a creature in your graveyard, except it's an artifact. It gains haste. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.
    *Relevance:* A "High Synergy" card. Since Purphoros forces you to sacrifice creatures, they end up in the graveyard. Feldon lets you bring them back temporarily, perfectly recycling the resources Purphoros used.

[^14]: **Chaos Warp** (Red | {2}{R}): The owner of target permanent shuffles it into their library, then reveals the top card of their library. If it's a permanent card, they put it onto the battlefield.
    *Relevance:* A "Staple" for Red. Red historically cannot destroy Enchantments. This card is a "catch-all" answer that removes *any* problem by shuffling it away, bypassing the color's usual weakness.

[^15]: **Meteor Golem** (Colorless/Artifact | {7}): When it enters the battlefield, destroy target nonland permanent.
    *Relevance:* Another "Staple" for colors with blind spots. Being colorless, it allows a Red or Black deck to destroy Enchantments, or a Green deck to destroy Creatures directly, covering the deck's weaknesses.

[^16]: **Sundial of the Infinite** (Colorless/Artifact | {2}): {1}, Tap: End the turn.
    *Relevance:* A "Hidden Gem/Combo." Purphoros says "Sacrifice at the beginning of the next end step." If you use the Sundial to *end your turn* while that sacrifice trigger is on the stack, the trigger is exiled, and you get to keep the creature forever.

[^17]: **Conjurer's Closet** (Colorless/Artifact | {5}): At the beginning of your end step, you may exile target creature you control, then return that card to the battlefield under your control.
    *Relevance:* Another "Hidden Gem." By exiling and returning the creature ("Flickering"), the game treats it as a brand new object. It loses the "must be sacrificed" tag applied by Purphoros, allowing you to keep it permanently.

[^18]: **Balefire Dragon** (Red | {5}{R}{R}): Flying. Whenever it deals combat damage to a player, it deals that much damage to each creature that player controls.
    *Relevance:* Represents an "Expensive/Powerful" card. It acts as a repeatable one-sided board wipe, which is why it commands a high financial price tag ($15+).

[^19]: **Bloodfire Colossus** (Red | {6}{R}{R}): {R}, Sacrifice Bloodfire Colossus: It deals 6 damage to each creature and each player.
    *Relevance:* Represents a "Budget Alternative." While it doesn't fly or stick around like the Dragon, it wipes the board for less than $0.50, proving that you can find powerful effects without spending much money.
